## 🌟 Features

- **PCB Defect Detection**: Identify and visualize defects in PCB images using YOLO object detection
- **Wafer Defect Analysis**: Process wafer data to detect and classify defects
- **S3 Integration**: Automatic storage and retrieval of images and data from AWS S3
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of defect patterns and statistics
- **User Feedback System**: Collect and analyze user feedback on detection accuracy
- **Multi-bucket Support**: Manage data across multiple S3 buckets

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separate components for different functionalities:

### Wafer Defect Analysis

Processes wafer data to identify defects and visualize patterns with custom color mapping:
- Purple: Background
- Green: Silicon
- Yellow: Defects

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AWS account with S3 access
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wafer-pcb-defect-detection.git
   cd wafer-pcb-defect-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies
3. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   # Set your AWS credentials in the appropriate files or use environment variables
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export AWS_REGION="your-region"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 🧩 Core Modules

### `app.py`
Main Flask application that integrates all components and handles routing.

### `Data_info.py`
Manages S3 bucket interactions, file listing, and folder structure analysis.

### `M1.py`
Handles PCB image processing, defect detection using YOLO, and image transformations.

### `M2.py`
Processes wafer data, generates visualizations, and provides defect analysis.

### `feedback_counter.py`
Tracks and analyzes user feedback on detection accuracy, storing results in S3.

## 🌐 Cloud Deployment

The application can be deployed to AWS EC2 via S3:

1. Upload essential files to an S3 bucket
2. On your EC2 instance:
   - Install Python and other dependencies
   - Download application files from S3
   - Configure AWS credentials
   - Run the Flask application (with Gunicorn/uWSGI for production)

## 🔧 Configuration

### S3 Buckets
The application uses multiple S3 buckets:
- `pcbdataset1`: For PCB images and detection results
- `waferdataset2`: For wafer data and feedback statistics

### Feedback System
User feedback is stored in the `waferdataset2` bucket in the `Feedback` folder, with:
- Counts of "Yes" and "No" responses
- Breakdown by defect type
- Historical feedback data
- Automatically generated reports
